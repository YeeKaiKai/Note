### What is Machine Learning?
- A field of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed
### Difference Between Machine Learning and Deep Learning
- Deep Learning is a sub-field of machine learning for learning representation of data

| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Feature Engineering | Need to extract features                         | Learn features automatically |
| Model Type          | Traditional algorithm (e.g., SVN, Decision Tree) | Neural network               |
| Data Requirement    | small amount of data                             | a lot of data                |
