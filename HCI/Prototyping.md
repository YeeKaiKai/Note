### Goal
- **Envisionment**: making ideas visible
- Use different tools and techniques according to the stage of design and the intended audience
- **Error to avoid**: focusing on the user interface before focusing on the task that the user has to accomplish
### Techniques
- Sketches: [[Task Analysis#Storyboard]]
- Maps: 顯示程式的導覽路徑與階層結構
- Prototypes
	- low fidelity (paper): 重點放在資訊和互動設計，欠細節
	- video
	- medium fidelity
	- high fidelity: 注重細節，與最終產品相似
### Durability
- **Throw-away Prototype**: used to assess some qualities of the system (gain knowledge), then discarded 用完就丟
- **Incremental Prototype**: the system is developed as incremental modules, each of them released in a seperate step 慢慢增加
- **Evolutionary Prototype**: the prototype becomes the product; each product iteration builds upon the previous one 迭代增加
### Paper Prototype
- 以手繪方式在紙上模擬介面以及互動流程
- 以人力模擬電腦反應
- Need: computer actor, facilitator, observer
