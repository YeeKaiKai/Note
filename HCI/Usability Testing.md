### Controlled Experiment
- Hypothesis
	- **null hypothesis**
		- 通常用來表示沒有影響、沒有效果的情況
		- need to be disproved
		- 給定一個零假說，並試著證明他錯誤，以此得到想要的結果
- Variables
	- things to manipulate and measure, to test the hypothesis
### Usability Testing ( User Testing )
- Goal
	- Identify problems in the design
	- Uncovering oppotunities to improve
	- Learning about the target user's behavior and preferences
- Facilitator
	- 指引 participants
	- 最好是清楚流程但不知道系統詳細架構的人，不然可能會說出答案
- Task
	- Tasks in usability test are realistic activities that the participant might perform in real life
		- e.g., Your printer is showing "Error 5200". How can you get rid of the error message?
- Participants
	- they already use the system
	- the are "similar" to the target user group
	- **need 5 participants** 
- Qualitative or Quantitative
	- qualitative usability testing focuses on collecting insights, findings, and anecdotes about how people use the product or service
	- quantitative usability testing focuses on collecting metrics that describe the user experience, e.g., task success and time on task
- 3 steps of usability testing
	- Plan
		- who are your participants? what, where and how are you going to test?
		- 5 participants are typically enough
		- at least a facilitator, 1-2 note-takers and observers
		- between 5-10 tasks typically, with clear goal, detailed success/failed criteria for each task
		- any additional information need or want to ask before and/or after the task, each tash, a meaningful group of tasks
		- **informed consent form**
		![[Pasted image 20250212171140.png]]
		- develop a written test protocol ( "script" ) for consistency among sessions
	- Run
		- one participant at time, multiple sessions
		- collect data about the interactive system/interface
		- informed consent, better in written format
		- tell participants "all mistakes are app's fault, not yours."
	- Analyze
		- extract information from the collected data, both qualitative and quantitative
- Tasks
	- Make the task realistic, actionable, and clues and describing the steps
	- Measuring success example: complete success, success with a minor issue, success with a major issue, failure
- Post-task Questionnaire
	- Single Ease Question (SEQ)
		- short (1-3 questions) to interfere as little as possible with the flow of using the system in a sesion
		- 7-point Likert scale from very easy to very difficult
	- System Usability Scale (SUS)
		- a "quick and dirt" (but trustable) usability scale
		- measures the **perceived usability** of a system
		- 10 questions and each has 5 response options ( 非常不同意，... )
		- 計分方式為奇數題：回答分數 - 1；偶數題：5 - 回答分數，所有分數加總乘以 2.5
		- a SUS score above 68 is considered **above average**
	- NASA Task Load indeX (NASA-TLX)
		- Measuring the **perceived workload** required by the complex, highly technical tasks of aerospace crew members
		- 6 questions on an unlabeled 21-point scale, each question addresses one dimestion of the perceived workload:
			- mental demand, physical demand, time pressure, perceived success with the task, overall effort level, and frustation level
- Methodology
	- Think-Aloud: In a thinking aloud test, you test participants to use the system while continuously thinking out loud - that is, simply verbalizing their thoughts as they move through the user interface
		- 3 things to do
			- recruit representative users
			- give them representative tasks to perform
			- shut up and let the users do the talking
	- Cooperative Evaluation: Variation of the think-aloud
		- the participant and the facilitator collaborate both can ask each other questions during the evaluation
