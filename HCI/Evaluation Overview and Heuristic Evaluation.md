- have different evaluations during the design
- usability test
- evaluation: tests the usability, functionality and acceptability
	- usability: how well users can use the system's functionality
	- functionality: the system's functionality must accord with the user's requirements and should enable users to perform their intended tasks.
	- acceptability: one's perception of a system before use
	- acceptance: one's perception of the system after use
### Evaluation Approahes:
	- in-the-laboratory studies: ( 推薦這個 ) controlled tests ( 大概就是模擬環境測試 )
		- 高控制但較不自然
	- in-the-wild studies: user's work enviornment ( 實際環境測試 )
		- 自然但低控制
	- experimental methods and observational methods: choose a hypothesis to test, which can be determined by measuring some attribute of partcipant behavior
	- query techniques (interviews): 捧著介面去問用戶 
### cognitive walkthrough
- step-by-step revision of a sequence of actions to perform a given task, examine each step, looking for possible problems
	- need: 
		- a specification or prototype of the system
		- a description of the task the user need to perform on the system
		- a complete, written list of the actions needed to complete the task
		- an indication of who the users are (experience, knowledge)
	- **for each step, must check**: 
		- Is the effect of the action the same as the user's goal at that point? 
		- Will users see that the action is available? 
		- Once users have found the correct action, will they know it is the one they need?
		- After the action is taken, will users understand the feedback they get?
### Heuristic Evaluation (Design Critique)
- basic idea ( 大概就是找一坨很熟那領域的專家噴爆你的設計 )
	- Define a set of heuristics (or principles)
	- Give those heuristics to a group of experts
	- Experts work independently
	- At the end, experts communicate and share their findings
	- The discovered violations of the heuristics are used
- phases of heuristic evaluation
	- pre-evaluation training ( 先輩知識 )
	- evaluation (**individual**): 列出 usability problems，違反什麼 heuristic rules
	- severity rating
		- first, individually; then, aggregate and find consensus
		- combination of **frequency, impact and persistence**
		- scale from 0 to 4
	- debriefing
- 綜合考量與 Nielsen 得出的結論，3-5 位專家最好
- 10 Nielsen's Usability Heuristics
	- Visibility of system status 
		- 比如讀取要有正在讀取的畫面
		- 時間長建議有進度條，短則讀取畫面
	- Match between system and the real world 
		- 講人話，避免特定領域的術語
	- User control and freedom
		- 可以 undo 或 redo，讓 user 離開 mistake，called "emergency exit"
	- Consistency and standards
		- 一樣的東西在不同地方也要長一樣，要有規律
	- Error prevention
		- 防呆
	- Recognition rather than recall
		- 提供提示，讓使用者不用空想
		- 像是編譯器會給我們相似指令，或 word 字體名稱上已經有那字體的效果
	- Flexibility and efficiency of use
		- 提供 shortcut 讓新手或老手用，且不影響另一方體驗 ( default + options )，最好能客製化
	- Aesthetic and minimalist design
		- 介面精簡、乾淨
	- Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
		- 錯誤訊息寫清楚，怎麼辦
	- Help and documentation
		- 提供必要文檔，但也不要太多
- Example
	- 列出 Where ( 問題在哪 )， What ( 什麼問題 )， Why ( 為什麼違反 heuristic )， Severity
		- What: Specify your language
		- What: The app uses "Save" for saving information, except here where it uses "Store".
		- Why: It is an inconsistent terminology for the same function in the application, which can create confusion
		- Severity: 3
	- 最後列個表格寫出所有的問題，以及 Severity 評分標準
- Summarize
